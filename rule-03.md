##3. Build upon the basics
The picture of the learned whole (as discussed in Rule 2: Learn before you memorize) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass. You can always build upon them later on.

Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material [[source](https://www.supermemo.com/articles/theory.htm)]! Basics are usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time. However, each memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly!

##原则三：构建于基础

对于学习材料的整体印象并不需要完善到细枝末节处。恰恰相反，该印象越简单越好，书籍的起始章节也是越短越好。越是简单的知识模型越是容易被理解和涵盖。日后你可以在此基础上进一步的构建。

不要忽视基础。记忆看似浅显的知识并不是在浪费时间。掌握基础看似轻松而且花费的时间也不多。但不要掉以轻心。记住，通常你会花费50%的时间来复习3%-5%学习过的材料[[来源](https://www.supermemo.com/articles/theory.htm)]! 而基础知识却只要花很少的时间就能记住。但是对基础知识的任一疏忽，往往代价沉重。
