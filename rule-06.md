##6. Use imagery
Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli are interpreted. It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we say one picture is worth a thousand words. Indeed if you look at the number of details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile.

Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.

The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan's mind maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.

##原则六：使用图片

视觉皮层是大脑中用来处理视觉刺激的部分。该部分在进化过程中得以充分的发展，这也是为什么我们常常会说一图胜千言。事实上，如果你观察一幅图片中的细节以及记忆这些细节的容易程度，你会发现，我们的语言能力相较于视觉处理能力真是差太多了。对于记忆也是如此，用图片展示的信息通常不太容易忘记。

当然，组织一道简单的问答题比找到一幅切题的图片要花费更少的时间。这也是为什么当你在学习过程使用图片时，往往需要在性价比上做出权衡。使用得当的图片，在诸如解剖学，地理学，几何学，化学和历史等领域，会极大的减少你的学习时间。

图片的威力也解释了为什么托尼·博赞的思维导图概念会如此流行。思维导图是一种将各组成部分连接起来的抽象图片，以此来反映个体概念间的逻辑关联。
